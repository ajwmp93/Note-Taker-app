# Note Taker

## Description
I made this application so that I could easily add notes and descriptions so I can keep track of the things I need to do. This will allow me to easily see the notes when they are posted to the sidebar of the webpage with a title and a body describing the note or task.

## Usage
Click on the Get Started button. It will take you to the notes page where you will click Note Title and enter your title for your note and then click Note Text where you will enter the text you want for your note body and then click the save note button at the top right or clear note button if you wish to start over. Your note will then be saved to the sidebar for easy viewing.

## Credits
I was helped by previous activities in the class and ChatGPT to debug some of my code.
